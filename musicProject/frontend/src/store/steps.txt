1. create a store with the help of configureStore, which is an object , then create an another folder reducer and export the complete configure store object by naming it store!
2. in main.jsx wrap the app component with provider and gave an attribute store and in it give the value "store" which is the exported from configureStore
3. create a reducer folder in store and create slices in it eg: musicSlice 
4. in musicSlice.jsx import createSlice which is again an object , in it create name attribute , initial state which hold the data and export the complete object as eg: musicSlice.reducer.

for: synchronous action

create an reducers folder inside the particular slice, and enter a key value pair wise method and eg: delete: (state,action)=>{} // state is data and action has 2 things (type and payload ) payload is the argument you gave to the action when called(dispatched)

actions don't call, they dispatch   // dispatch is an hook from redux.
